Firstly, make sure you have a balanced diet and get enough sleep. Regular physical activity can also help to reduce stress levels. Try to avoid last-minute cramming and break your study sessions into smaller, manageable chunks.

Create a study schedule and prioritize your tasks. Focus on understanding the concepts rather than just memorizing information. If you find a particular topic difficult, consider seeking help from a tutor or a study group.

Remember, it's okay to take breaks and do activities you enjoy. This can help to refresh your mind and improve your focus when you return to studying.

Also, don't forget to take deep breaths and practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation, to help manage your stress levels.

Lastly, talk to someone about how you're feeling. This could be a friend, family member, teacher, or counselor. They can provide support and advice, and just talking about your feelings can help to reduce stress.

I hope these tips help, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams! If you have any more questions or need further advice, feel free to ask.",False
